This repository will provide a service binary to run the [Icinga PowerShell Framework](https://icinga.com/docs/windows/latest) as service on Windows machines. Afterwards it will allow you to [register background daemons](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/110-Installation/05-Background-Daemons/) to frequently run background tasks like executing checks or providing different kind of services.

* Windows 7 / Windows 2008 R2 or later
* PowerShell Version 4.x or higher
* .NET Framework 4.x or higher
* [Icinga PowerShell Framework](https://icinga.com/docs/windows) installed
